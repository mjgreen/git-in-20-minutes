Hi All,

The Research Forum on Wednesday the 1st of February (1-2:30 in F205 – Fusion Building) will focus on Open Science and will be led by myself and Matt.

This second open science forum will discuss transparency and open access resources in psychological science. The intention is for this session to be highly accessible for those new to open science practices. However, we intend these sessions to be dialogic (who knew that was an actual word) – so it would be really useful to hear from those cynical and battle-scarred sharers of data, code, tasks etc. The intention is to provide some practical introduction to sharing resources on the OSF and GitHub – but we also hope for some impassioned and shouty disputes that will, with some luck, turn to actual violence.  So, in the spirit of self-preservation, please attend with a weapon and the fighting spirit of a Cape Buffalo.

Look forward to seeing you there.

Best wishes,
